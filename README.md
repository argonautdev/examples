# Deploying a simple NodeJS Express API using Argonaut

## Initialize the node project

Only if you haven't done so already.

- Using your package manager, initialize the project. We are using npm here, so `npm init` is used.
- Add express as a dependency in the project using `npm i express`.
- Create an entry file to your project called `index.js` in your root directory.
- Add `start: node index.js` inside the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file.
- Use the code below to create a simple API that sends PING_PONG as response.

### index.js
```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();

app.get('/', (_req, res) => res.send("PING_PONG"));

app.listen(process.env.NODE_PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on ${process.env.NODE_PORT}`)
})
```

### Before deploying Argonaut needs to know some key information about how to run your app. 
 - `Build Method` : Here you can choose which node version you need. We have selected node:latest
 - `Build Context` : Here you can specify a subfolder that will act as the root directory of the app during the build
 - `Run Command` : Command to run the project
 - `Secrets` : Secrets are exposed to the app as environment variables. They will be populated in `process.env` inside our Node project.

- After filling up all these fields, click on the 'Deploy' button. You will immediately be taken to the logs screen.
